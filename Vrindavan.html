    <h2>Historical and Religious Significance</h2>
    
    Vrindavan is intrinsically linked to the life of Lord Krishna, one of the most beloved deities in Hinduism. According to ancient scriptures and legends, Vrindavan is where Krishna spent his childhood, enchanting the world with his divine plays and miracles. The town's name, derived from 'Vrinda' (another name for the holy basil plant) and 'van' (meaning forest), indicates the lush groves where Krishna would play with his friends and tend to cows.
    
    <h2> Major Attractions and Temples</h2>
