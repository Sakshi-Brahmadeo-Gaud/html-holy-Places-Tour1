    <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
    Jagannath Puri Dham, located in the coastal town of Puri in the state of Odisha, India, is one of the four sacred Char Dham pilgrimage sites for Hindus. It is renowned for its grand temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath (a form of Lord Vishnu), along with his siblings Balabhadra and Subhadra. This holy site attracts millions of devotees and tourists from around the world each year.
    
    <h2> Historical Background</h2>
    The Jagannath Temple was built in the 12th century by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The temple's architectural style reflects the rich Kalinga heritage and stands as a testament to the grandeur of ancient Indian temple architecture. The deities worshipped here are unique wooden idols, which are ceremoniously replaced every twelve to nineteen years in a grand event known as Navakalevara.
    
    <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
    The Jagannath Temple is an architectural masterpiece with its towering spire rising to 214 feet. The main structure consists of four distinct sections:
    - <h3>Vimana</h3>: The sanctum sanctorum where the deities are enshrined.
    - <h3>Jagamohana</h3>: The assembly hall where devotees congregate.
    - <h3>Nata Mandir</h3>: The festival hall used for dance and other festivities.
    - <h3>Bhoga Mandapa</h3>: The hall where offerings are made to the deities.
    
    The temple complex is surrounded by a high fortified wall known as Meghanada Pacheri, adding to its majestic appearance.
    
    <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
    Jagannath Puri is considered one of the holiest places in Hinduism. It is believed that visiting this site purifies the soul and grants liberation (moksha).
